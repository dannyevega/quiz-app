	description: "In 2011, Nike Inc. released the Nike MAG as a result of public demand. The highly-sought after shoe was initially featured in the movie Back to the Future Part II. Famed Nike Designer, Tinker Hatfield, was asked to create the futuristic shoe for the second installment of the movie series in 1989. Stand out features included light-up panels and self-fastening shoe laces. Over 15 years later, an online petition for an official release of the shoe made it's way on sneaker forums and caught the attention of Tinker. He and footwear innovator, Tiffany Beers, began working on the shoe and in 2011, 1,500 pairs were released on eBay with all proceeds going to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Disease. A total of  US $9.4 million was raised in donations with shoe prices up to US $10,000 per pair."

	description: "Game 5 of the 1997 NBA finals with the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz will forever be known as the Michael Jordan Flu Game. While his stats for the game were pretty impressive with 38 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, and 3 steals, it was his ability to play through the game with the flu. Jordan was barely able to sit up before the game and fought to stand up after. He endured the hardwood for 44 minutes and scored a definitive game-clinching three-pointer that ultimately led to the Bulls 3-2 upper hand in the series with a Game 6 closeout. MJ wore the Air Jordan XII in the Black/Red colorway in Game 5 which were later nicknamed the \"Flu Games\" and will always be a reminder of his amazing performance that night. In recent years, the shoes have sold for US $104,765."

The shell toe sneaker is still an iconic silhouette to this day."
